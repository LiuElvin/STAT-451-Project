For this project, we aim to explore trends in chronic disease across various demographics and regions in the US, focusing on how specific health indicators -- both chronic disease symptoms and broader wellness metrics like physical and mental health â€”- are changing over the recent years. The main research question guiding our work is: How do chronic disease indicators, alongside other health metrics, vary across regions over time, and what factors might be driving these changes? By creating visual representations of these trends, we aim to not only highlight disparities across different regions but also assess the effectiveness of regional health initiatives. We plan to focus on indicators with significant fluctuations or connections to high mortality rates, as these could signal key public health issues. This approach will allow us to capture critical trends and assess whether current public health initiatives are successfully promoting overall health across communities.

The primary dataset for this analysis is the "U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators, 2023 Release", which tracks 124 health indicators across the United States, offering a comprehensive view of chronic disease metrics. This dataset includes data points from diverse state and federal agencies, allowing us to capture a wide array of regional trends. To contextualize changes in these indicators, we will examine major events that may influence health trends, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a substantial impact on both physical and mental health metrics. Since the dataset generally includes annual data points, we plan to highlight a few of these major events to see how they may have caused fluctuations in specific health indicators. In addition to this main dataset, we may incorporate data from other sources for a more detailed view of certain health metrics (e.g. depression statistics), however those are fairly available (especially for major problems like mental health). Some examples would be these links to data on [nutrition and physical activity](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nutrition-physical-activity-and-obesity-behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system) and the annual reports on [mental health and drug use](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health). If we want to draw comparisons to worldwide trends, WHO also have a large dataset for each year at the link [here](https://data.who.int/). The main dataset is quite large (350 mb), so I've provided a link to the data [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi).
